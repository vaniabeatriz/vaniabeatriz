### Hey! I am Vania Beatriz,

I am a software developer graduate studying Cloud Computing, Python, and SQL. I hold a nanodegree Software certificate from the Code First Girls Bootcamp, alongside a Product Management certification from Udacity. I am passionate about technology and innovation. At the moment, I work in Data Analysis. I am working on documenting my tech journey on my website (coming soon!), where I will showcase my projects.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm very social and love organizing small parties for my friends and family, but my hobbies are rather quiet and relaxing. I like writing, I enjoy reading, and I participate in a book club with friends. I also love cinema and I host a film club once every two months to discuss our impressions of a previous chosen film. This way, we can learn about other points of view and perceptions and learn from each other. And that's why I chose the theme of my final project of the Bootcamp to be a website to get random films from a public API.
