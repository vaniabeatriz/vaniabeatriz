💫 About me:
🐜 I'm very social and enjoy planning small parties for friends and family to play board games and engage in conversations about various topics, from the latest tech trends to new ways of thinking about the world and our society. My purpose in life is to cultivate curiosity, embrace whatever life brings, and maintain an open mind and a positive perspective in the face of our ever-changing world.
🤓 I enjoy writing, reading, and dancing. I also love solving jigsaw puzzles, watching movies, and I host a film club once every two months.
